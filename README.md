This is a simple, multi-user real-time chat application built using sockets in C++. 
The system allows multiple clients to connect to a server and chat in Direct Messages (DMs), simulating private conversations. 
All messages exchanged between the server and clients are stored in a file for historical reference, and the system runs indefinitely until one of the participants closes the connection (via Ctrl+C).
The chat system uses multithreading to handle multiple client connections simultaneously, providing a responsive and efficient chatting experience.
